Assignment Description:
You will be building a 1-page app. Pick a subject that you can disagree with - both
points of view should appear in the final submission. As an example, one person
could argue that dogs are best, the other person could argue that in fact cats are
WAY better than dogs. Create a simple page with images and text. Divide the page
into two sections; the first section is arguing FOR, the second is arguing AGAINST.
Create a conflict with your teammate before you get too far into the assignment;
resolve it.
Create a Github repo with a ReadMe file; push the project and submit the link
