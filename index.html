        <p>Although you can for sure walk your cat which is very wholesome, cats don't need to be walked daily for exercise. Cats are able to get their daily exercise from playing indoors with toys which a lot of pet owners prefer. Dogs need to be walked regardless of how cold or hot it is outside. Dogs especialy require more excercise when living in apartments which cats don't.</p>
        <h3>Cats are cheaper to own.</h3>

        <p>Owning a pet is expensive regardless but, vet bills for cats are cheaper. Cats don't need as much maitenance or care like dogs resulting in cheaper and fewer vet bills. Cats don't require as much food, water, toys, and space like dogs do resulting in much lower costs when owning one.</p>
