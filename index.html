        <p>I have so many reasons why Dogs are better than cats! Dogs are the most loyal creatures alive, they will stay by your side no matter what if you treat them right. 
            Take the movie hachi for example, he senses his owner won't be coming home and tries his hardest to get him to stay than after the human dies he stays where he used to get off from work until he dies.
            This was based on a true story of an actual dog and I've heard many tails (pun intended) of even more just like Hachi.</p><br>

            <p> You also can't deny their cuteness!!! I mean have you seen puppies and their sweet dorky faces?? </p> <br>

            <br> <p> Dogs not only are the sweetest little guys they're also super affectionate! Dogs love pets and always want to be around their favourite people and while they may need a little more care than 
                cats in the long run it's worth it. Dogs help with mental health as well and not just for companionship, having a dog forces you to go on daily walks which is a great motivators for those who 
                wouldn't normally get out
